The primary objective of this experiment is to gain a thorough understanding of the steps involved in Polygon Clipping Algorithms, specifically focusing on how these algorithms facilitate the rendering of only the visible portion of a polygon within a defined display area. The experiment provides a detailed exploration of the Sutherland-Hodgeman Algorithm, offering a step-by-step breakdown of its execution.

By the end of this experiment, participants should:

1. Acquire a conceptual grasp of polygon clipping in computer graphics.
2. Comprehend the sequential steps of the Sutherland-Hodgeman Algorithm for polygon clipping.
3. Recognize the significance of polygon clipping in optimizing visual rendering.
4. Develop practical insights into the implementation of the Sutherland-Hodgeman Polygon Clipping Algorithm.

This objective aims to equip participants with both theoretical knowledge and practical skills, enhancing their proficiency in polygon clipping techniques within the context of computer graphics.
