**Procedure: Sutherland-Hodgeman Polygon Clipping Experiment**

1. **Fix Clipping Window:**
   - Ensure the parameters for the clipping window are filled in the input boxes.

2. **Start Experiment with Default Values:**
   - Enter the vertices of the polygon in the input box using the format:
    (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>), (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>), (x<sub>3</sub>, y<sub>3</sub>), (x<sub>4</sub>, y<sub>4</sub>), (x<sub>5</sub>, y<sub>5</sub>)
   - These vertices represent the polygon's consecutive order, with the last vertex connected to the first to complete the polygon.
   - Default vertices are pre-filled. Finalize the coordinates and click on "Submit" to begin.

3. **Navigate Through Experiment:**
   - During the experiment, click on "Next" to progress to the next step of the Sutherland-Hodgeman Algorithm.

4. **Conduct Multiple Experiments:**
   - After the experiment concludes, you can experiment with new sets of polygon vertices.

This procedure guides you through the steps of the Sutherland-Hodgeman Polygon Clipping Experiment, allowing you to fix the clipping window, start the experiment with default or custom polygon vertices, navigate through iterations, and conduct multiple experiments as needed.
