**Procedure: Sutherland-Hodgeman Polygon Clipping Experiment**

1. **Fix Clipping Window:**
   - Ensure the default parameters for the clipping window are filled in the input boxes.
   - Click on the "Enter" button to fix the clipping window.

2. **Start Experiment with Default Values:**
   - Click on "Start Experiment with Default Values" to proceed directly to the experiment.
   - Enter the vertices of the polygon in the input box using the format:
     \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4), (x_5, y_5)\)
   - These vertices represent the polygon's consecutive order, with the last vertex connected to the first to complete the polygon.
   - Default vertices are pre-filled. Finalize the coordinates and click on "Start Experiment" to begin.

3. **Navigate Through Experiment:**
   - During the experiment, click on "Next Iteration" to progress to the next step of the Sutherland-Hodgeman Algorithm.

4. **Conduct Multiple Experiments:**
   - After the experiment concludes, you can experiment with new sets of polygon vertices.
   - To do this, click on "Back" to adjust the values of the frame buffer and start a new experiment.

This procedure guides you through the steps of the Sutherland-Hodgeman Polygon Clipping Experiment, allowing you to fix the clipping window, start the experiment with default or custom polygon vertices, navigate through iterations, and conduct multiple experiments as needed.
